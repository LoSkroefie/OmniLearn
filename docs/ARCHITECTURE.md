# OmniLearn Architecture

## Overview
OmniLearn is built using a modern, scalable architecture that combines powerful backend services with an intuitive frontend interface. This document outlines the key architectural decisions and components.

## System Architecture

### Backend Stack
- **Node.js & Express**: Core server framework
- **Apollo Server**: GraphQL API implementation
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database
- **Redis**: Caching and session management
- **OpenAI Integration**: AI-powered content generation and analysis

### Frontend Stack
- **React**: UI framework
- **Apollo Client**: GraphQL client
- **Material-UI**: Component library
- **D3.js**: Knowledge graph visualization
- **React Router**: Client-side routing

## Key Components

### 1. Knowledge Graph Engine
- Custom graph database implementation
- Real-time graph traversal and visualization
- Dynamic relationship mapping
- Semantic search integration

### 2. Learning Path System
- Adaptive learning algorithms
- Progress tracking
- Resource management
- Achievement system

### 3. Content Management
- Version control system
- Collaborative editing
- Content verification
- AI-powered summarization

### 4. Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Session management
- Security middleware

## Data Flow

1. **User Requests**
   - Client sends GraphQL query/mutation
   - Apollo Client handles caching
   - Request authenticated via JWT

2. **Server Processing**
   - Apollo Server validates request
   - Resolvers process data
   - Database operations executed
   - Cache updated as needed

3. **Response Handling**
   - GraphQL response formatted
   - Client cache updated
   - UI re-rendered as needed

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Containerized deployment with Docker
- Load balancing configuration
- Database replication
- Cache distribution

### Performance Optimization
- Query optimization
- Connection pooling
- Batch processing
- CDN integration

## Security Measures

1. **Authentication**
   - JWT token validation
   - Password hashing
   - Session management
   - Rate limiting

2. **Data Protection**
   - Input validation
   - SQL injection prevention
   - XSS protection
   - CSRF protection

3. **API Security**
   - GraphQL depth limiting
   - Query complexity analysis
   - Error handling
   - Audit logging

## Monitoring & Logging

- Performance metrics collection
- Error tracking
- User activity monitoring
- System health checks

## Deployment Architecture

### Development
- Local development environment
- Hot reloading
- Development database
- Test suite

### Production
- Docker containers
- CI/CD pipeline
- Production database cluster
- Load balancer

## Future Considerations

1. **Scalability**
   - Microservices architecture
   - Event-driven systems
   - Enhanced caching

2. **Features**
   - Real-time collaboration
   - Advanced analytics
   - Mobile applications
   - API marketplace

3. **Integration**
   - Third-party learning platforms
   - Content providers
   - Authentication providers
   - Payment systems
